# Starting-a-new-fMRI-project
Info about the first steps to do when starting a new fMRI project: 
- Get feedback on your design;
- Ethical submission;
- Acquire data at GIfMI (Ghent Institute for Functional and Metabolic Imaging).

---
## Presentation of your fMRI design to get useful feedback from the fMRI community (optional but recommended)

#### Once your experimental design is almost ready, it would be good to present it to our fMRI community to get feedbacks and suggestions about it. 
 

**You can find in the current repository the template for such presentation (both in [.pptx](https://github.com/fMRI-ugent/starting-a-new-fMRI-project/blob/main/Template_fMRInewDesign.pptx) and in [.key](https://github.com/fMRI-ugent/starting-a-new-fMRI-project/blob/main/Template_fMRInewDesign.key) formats)**


The format of these presentations should be:
- a short introduction of your experimental hypothesis and questions you want to address
- a more detailed description of your experimental design
- an overview of your expected results and how these will support or not your hypothesis

for a total length of 15/20 minutes.

Having feedback and suggestions from other fMRI experts at this early stage of your experiment will help you improve your design before the MRI acquisition starts and decrease the possibility of regretting your choices once you will be analysing your data or writing your papers! 
 
Contact the fMRI support postdoc Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be), to book a slot for your presentation.

## Ethical submission
#### When you start a new project or experiment you need to get an ethical approval.

This can be done through the Hiruz website:
- Go to the [website of hiruz](https://hiruz.be/) and click the research portal, which is the new [platform for ethical approval](https://hiruz.be/research-portal/).
- The info on how to register to the portal and get access are [here](https://uzgent.be/over-uz-gent/organisatie/commissie-voor-medische-ethiek/onderzoeksportaal/hoe-krijg-ik-toegang-tot-het-onderzoeksportaal) but only in dutch!!

## Aquire data at GIfMI: several steps
#### All the manuals and documents listed below (and further info) can be find on the [GIfMI website](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/).
##### IMPORTANT: you need ethical approval to start the data acquisition procedure at GIfMI!

###  *MRI Safety Course*

This is a mandatory course to learn which are the risks in the magnetic resonance environment and how to avoid them.
This training consists of 2 parts (both mandatory): 
1. 60min e-learning course to be followed online
2. on site illustration

**YOU ALREADY FOLLOWED THE SAFETY COURSE IN THE PAST. SHOULD YOU TAKE IT AGAIN FOR YOUR NEW MRI STUDY? Here the general rules:**
1. Anybody who wants to work in the facility has to follow the safety training initially;
2. If you have participated in a training at GIfMI for a previous study and you have subsequently worked in the facility (i.e. you participated in the scanning procedure of an experiment), you don't need to follow the on site training again. If it has been more than a year, it is strongly recommend to follow the e-learning again. Ask Stefania Mattioni (stefania.mattioni@ugent.be for the e-learning course).
3. If you followed the training in the past (e.g. one year ago) but the project never started, you never gained experience with working in the facility --> you need to follow the training (both e-learning and on site) again.

**Contact the GIfMI research assistant Stephanie Bogaert - Stephanie.Bogaert@UZGent.be to know when is the next available safety course.**


### *Submit the GIfMI Study Proposal Form to the Site Menager*
The GIfMI site manager is Pieter Vandemaele (Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be).
You can find the [Study Proposal Form here](https://mrighent.ugent.be/site/assets/doc/GIfMI_study_proposal_form_EN.pdf).
After the acceptance of your study proposal you will get a GSB number for your project (used for all comunication and booking). 

### *Book your slot for Technical test and protocol tuning* 
Contact the GIfMI site menager Pieter Vandemaele - Pieter.Vandemaele@UGent.be to book your 2h slot;
During this time (free of charge) Pieter Vandemaele will set your scanning protocol and will help you with all the technical test (trigger, button box, etc..)  

### *Book your scanning time - the new Core Facility Management Software (CFMS)* 

Starting from June 1st, 2024 every PI who wants to run (f)MRI experiments needs to be registered in the **CFMS system**. Then, all lab members who will be in charge of data acquisition need to be registered under their PI's lab and can reserve the facility with the approval of the PI. 

You can find the detailed documentation on CFMS [here](https://mrighent.ugent.be/doc/cfms/). This website is continuously updated, so check back for additional information from time to time.
The key information about the use of the CFMS and the new booking/invoicing system has been summarized in [this email](GIfMI_email_on_CFMS.pdf) by the GIfMI team. Please read it carefully!



### *Highly reccomended videos to be watched before the start of scanning (especially for non-expert users*
A highly recommended starter is the set of PEPConnect training videos.
These are locatated [here](https://pep.siemens-info.com/en-us/magnetom-prisma-magnetom-prisma-fit).
You will need to create a login.
The videos are organized in three main sections. The relevant ones are listed below:
 
*System Overview*
- Dual Monitor Setup
- System Messages and Message History
- Scan UI Online self test (todo after having watched all other videos)
  
*Routine Workflow*
- System start-up and Home-screen
- Patient Registration
- Program Selection
- Scheduler
- Exam Workflow
- Job Aids (PDF met info)

*Post-processing and Reading*
- MR View&GO Basic Online Training
- MR View&GO Advancend Online Training
- Configuration
- Reset Layout Function
- 3D Reference Point
- Distribution
- Patient Browser
- MR View&GO Online Self-Assessment
